1. Which were the total Rental Orders Per Staff?
2. Which were the Top 10 clients in 2007, how many payments and their amounts?
3. What are the differences shown across months, for the top clients in 2007?

The results were visually plotted using Tableau Desktop and are located in the SQL_Project folder, in the report.pdf file.
